# Jarvis-AI-voice-Assistance
Built a Python-based voice assistant with wake-word activation to perform tasks like Google/Wikipedia search, opening websites, reporting time/date, and playing music using speech recognition and text-to-speech

## Objective
To develop an intelligent voice assistant that automates daily tasks, provides information through speech interaction, and improves user efficiency using Python, speech recognition, and text-to-speech technologies.

## process

- Initialize the text-to-speech engine using pyttsx3 to enable Jarvis to speak.
  
- Greet the user based on the current time (morning, afternoon, or evening).

- Continuously listen for the wake word “Jarvis” using speech recognition.

- Respond immediately when the wake word is detected and activate command listening.

- Process commands such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, or reporting time and date.

- Execute the requested actions using Python modules and web browser integration.

- Return to listening for the wake word after completing each command.

- Exit the assistant when the user says “sleep,” “exit,” or “quit.”

## Features
- Wake word detection (“Jarvis”)

- Voice responses using Text-to-Speech

- Web automation (Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Stack Overflow)

- Wikipedia search

- Music playback from a library

- Time & date reporting

- Exit commands
